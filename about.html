                I'm Lucio Paiva, a software developer with a Computer Science Master's degree from Federal University of
                Rio de Janeiro. I currently live in Rio with my wife Priscila and work at Zwift, a very cool indoor
                cycling online game.

                Programming computers is my life's passion. I taught myself how to program by the age of 13 by reading a
                programming tutorial that came in an Electronics magazine called Microsistemas my father subscribed to.
                I started with Visual Studio 3, then I went to BASIC, Pascal and Delphi. Then I went reverse
                engineering other programs and eventually started to crack applications just for fun. I learned Intel
                assembly language, played a lot making my own experimental viruses and even wrote some Windows programs
                in pure assembly using MASM. [Iczelion's page][10] was a fantastic resource at the time and it is still
                online as I write this! Just amazing. I went to CEFET in 1998, a technical school in the Rio area where
                my father still teaches electronics as of today, where I took a technical-grade course on computer
                science. That's where I started to play with computer networking together with my friend Guilherme,
                playing a lot with BackOrifice, Netbus and started making my own "remote administration" tools.
                It taught me a lot about network connections,
                how network layers are designed and how operating systems deal with it. Fast-forward a few years, in
                2003 I joined UFRJ. It's a federal university, so you have to pass a test to enter it. I was probably
                the first candidate at that year (2003) that knew the results before the public announcement was made.
                I managed to crack the password algorithm that allowed candidates to check their test grades, so I made
                a little tool to crawl into every candidate's accounts and download it to my own database so I could
                rank candidates by grade myself. I could then verify that I was at position 15 in the overall ranking,
                meaning I passed :-) The password was composed of 10 numeric digits, by I had only figured out the first
                9. That meant I had to try up to 10 passwords for each candidate. I ended up running 10 sockets in
                parallel, each querying for one combination and then I recorded the right one. One year later I was able
                (with the help of my friend André Luiz) to crack the last digit, which was made of a series of modulus
                operations on the previous digits. It was also André that presented me to the best game I played so far:
                Ultima Online. I am a big fan of UO and my biggest joy with it was to automate my character to behave
                like it had a real intelligence behind it all the time. It would gather resources, move around the
                virtual world, buy and sell stuff, all unattended. I wrote several scripts for EasyUO,
                [some of them published][20], and I also started making my own macroing tool, LlamaScript. Although I
                never finished it, it was really fun to work on it. It would scan UO client's program memory, looking
                for certain assembly instructions, changing them at runtime and injecting code that would detour the
                game's logic to run my macroing tool's routines. Some years later I even started making my own
                experimental game client using Node.js and Chromium (before I knew about Electron). Speaking of games,
                as a child my favorite game by far was [Rome: AD 92][30]. Back in 2005 I found it among by backup stuff,
                played it a bit and then thought about writing to the original developer to thank him. To my surprise,
                not only [Steve Grand][40] replied to my email, he also gave me Rome's source code! Fast-forward to
                2009, I was finishing my graduation and my final project was an electronic chromatic guitar tuner, a
                hardware device having a PIC at its core that was responsible for detecting the periodicity of the
                input signal and translate it to the 12-tone equal temperament scale, showing how many cents the input
                tone was off using as reference the closest known note. It was my first attempt at playing with sound.
                Although it only worked for instruments whose fundamental frequency was the prevalent one, it worked
                pretty well. A few years later, in 2012, I was finishing my Master's degree and my final thesis theme
                was traffic coordination and control. And I mean traffic as in vehicles, not network packets :-) It was
                one of my earliest desires as a programmer to be able to make a vehicle simulation system. My academic
                advisor, Felipe França, presented me with an algorithm he devised to solve the [dining philosopher's
                problem][50] with varying priorities. The algorithm, known as
                [Scheduling By Multiple Edge Reversal][60], was applied by me to control the phases of a traffic signal
                according to incoming traffic, as well as to coordinate traffic corridors and guarantee maximum road
                efficiency by creating so-called green corridors and optimizing average speed and travel time. The
                simulator had one part made in Java and a separate process (a Java applet) that showed the simulation
                happening. I still want to revisit this project at some point and make a web application version of it.

                During the period of 2011 and 2014 I co-founded a startup with some friends and most of the time there
                I worked doing R&D. Our first product was a groceries price comparison mobile app called BoaLista. At
                that time I developed an information retrieval system to match and group products from different online
                stores that had no barcode information, so we could properly compare product prices and enlarge our
                product price base. So I designed my own algorithm for it and it worked with great precision. I had to
                take into account things like different product sizes, weights, flavors, typos, lack of standards when
                defining product names and descriptions, etc... it was really challenging.

                I like music. I can play the guitar (badly), but what I really like is to think about what makes sound
                be interpreted as music to our ears, why some frequencies go well with others while some don't, etc. I
                like reverse engineering sound and experimenting with it. In one of my professional endeavours, I had
                the chance to design my own sound transmission protocol, together with a hardware ultrasound emitter and
                a companion mobile native library to interpret it.

                I like to discuss religion to try to understand why people believe in things (me included). I don't
                believe in gods of any sorts, although I try to keep my mind open to new ideas. The thing is, there is
                no point in believing in a thing that you won't be able to interact with in an observable manner. I
                was born in a catholic family, so I was raised to believe in god. But then came my teenage years and I
                started to reject every concept that was put before me. As I started to reject the idea of a god, I saw
                that it wasn't doing me any harm. There was no thunder coming from the skies to strike me, no divine
                wrath of any kind. So I found out I didn't need to be fearful of god. I could even curse this supposed
                entity and nothing would happen. I made my own experiments and came to the conclusion that I was fine
                with not believing in anything, that it wouldn't make my life more miserable

                I think that life sucks, but don't take me wrong. I find my life to be amazing and I consider myself to
                be a very lucky guy. I have nothing to complain about my life exactly, but I do like to complain about
                life in general.

                I like people around me and I also consider myself to be very lucky to have met so many awesome people
                along the way, but I tend to hate humankind as a whole.

                I don't like this whole idea of human-made global warming, but I also have to be cautious to talk about
                it because everybody is so religious about it and I don't want people to get me wrong. I do think that
                there is something wrong about all this trend in which people started to believe, all out of the sudden,
                in Earth computer models that are probably totally wrong. People are stupid and their models will very
                likely be stupid as well. The problem is, climate deniers also happen to be the scum of mankind. They
                believe in non-renewable energy sources, they want to build walls and they are probably disguised nazis.
                That's where my problem lives. It's difficult to find someone that doesn't believe in human-made global
                warming which isn't a complete fuck. I'm not sure about human-made global warming, but I also think that
                renewable energies are an awesome thing. I really like the idea of self-sustainability and renewable
                energies are the only way mankind can continue for the long term.

                Religion also brings the subject of life itself.
